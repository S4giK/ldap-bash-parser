# ldap-bash-parser
Bash script to parse ldapsearch output and hunt for keywords to quickly find usernames / passwords.

please feel free to suggest some more logic, or fine tuning to make this script better :)

# This script has no logic, things may not work. why? because it is a simple script to parse ldapsearch queries.
# ldapsearch is REQUIRED.
apt install ldapscripts
# EXAMPLE ./ldapsearch_parser.sh "TARGET-IP"
